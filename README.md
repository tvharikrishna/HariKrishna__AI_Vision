# ☢️ What is Deep Learning Perception?

<p align='justify'>Deep Learning Perception refers to the application of deep learning algorithms to interpret and understand the content of digital images or videos. This branch of artificial intelligence mimics the human brain's ability to perceive and recognize patterns, enabling machines to make decisions based on visual inputs. It plays a crucial role in various domains such as autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and robotics, where visual cognition is critical.</p>
